# SIMPLE-LINEAR-REGRESSION

 Salary Prediction using Simple Linear Regression
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict an individual's salary based on their years of experience using Python and Scikit-learn.

📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict salary based on the number of years of experience using Simple Linear Regression.


🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn


📁 Dataset
Name: Salary_Data.csv

Columns:

YearsExperience: Number of years of professional experience

Salary: Annual salary in dollars

📍 Location: Salary_Data/Salary_Data.csv



🛠️ How It Works
Load the Dataset

Split the Data into Training and Testing sets (80/20 split)

Train the Model using LinearRegression()

Predict salaries based on the test set

Visualize the regression line and the test results


Possible Improvements
Add performance metrics (R², MSE, RMSE)

Save the model using pickle or joblib

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

Allow user input to predict salaries interactively
